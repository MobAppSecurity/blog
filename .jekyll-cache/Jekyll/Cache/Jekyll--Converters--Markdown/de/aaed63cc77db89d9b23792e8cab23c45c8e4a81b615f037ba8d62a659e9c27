I"7<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>Before we getting start with the content, I would like to mentioned that this material is not meant for beginner. If you never done Windows Exploit Development before I suggest to start reading my old blog about breaking the code series(<a href="https://court-of-testing-analysing.blogspot.com/2019/11/breaking-code-exploit-development.html">link</a>) this will give a general idea on how to setup and conduct research on windows binary.</p>

<p>This post was heavily inspired from the following <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46625">exploit-db</a>. You may notice later there are some differences on my exploit script but the concept is still the same with the original author.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

<h2> Setup Windows Lab </h2>

<p>In this lab I used Windows 7 from windows IE developer official (<a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/vms/">website</a>) and install several tools for exploit development in it, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Python 2.7</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Immunity Debugger</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Mona</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The vulnerable program, you can download it from the following <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46625">link</a></p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note 1: In this exploit, DEP is set to on, however I choose the option where it only affect some critical components in windows not our target program!</p>
