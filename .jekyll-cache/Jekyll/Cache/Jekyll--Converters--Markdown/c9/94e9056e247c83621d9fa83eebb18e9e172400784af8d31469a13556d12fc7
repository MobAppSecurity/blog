I"é<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>Hi everyone this will be an introduction on how to utilized dynamic analysis tools frida in Android. This post will go through on how to setup frida in rooted android and how to used it to make application bend to our will.</p>

<h2> Setting Up The Environment </h2>

<p>As I mentioned before, the android that we will be used is the rooted one, if you can get the real one, you can use a vm and set it up by yourself. I recommended to use genymotion to setup the vm, it‚Äôs easy and pretty straightforward to used(<a href="https://www.genymotion.com/download/">link</a>).</p>

<p>NOTE: You have to created a personal account there, in order to operate it in your device and make sure you already have virtualbox installed.</p>

<p>Next is to prepare the frida tools in the android and your pc. Basically frida worked like client and server. First, you have to run the frida server inside the rooted android and connect to the running server using the frida client. Where to ge it?</p>

<p>For frida client you can installed it by using pip utility and based on the picture aboved I install the client in my kali linux with 14-2.13 as the version.</p>

<p>To configure the server you have to download the binary from the official github repository(<a href="https://github.com/frida/frida/releases">link</a>). To play safe I‚Äôm just going to choose the binary version that matched with my frida client.</p>

<p>You might be wondering why I choose to download the x86 arch for the server well its because the android vm running in genymotion is running x86 arch(you can check your vm arch by running the adb command above)</p>

<p>Note: if you used a real device there‚Äôs a fat chance that it will be using ARM arch</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="http://localhost:4000/blog/img/frida/frida7.png" alt="PLIST-FILE_3" /></p>

<p>Extract the zip file and put it into the ‚Äú/data/local/tmp‚Äù folder in your rooted android, of course! you can used other directory as long as you remember it where.</p>
