I"Ù<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>Before we getting start with the content, I would like to mentioned that this material is not meant for beginner. If you never done Windows Exploit Development before I suggest to start reading my old blog about breaking the code series(<a href="https://court-of-testing-analysing.blogspot.com/2019/11/breaking-code-exploit-development.html">link</a>) this will give a general idea on how to setup and conduct research on windows binary. This post was heavily inspired from the following <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/46625">exploit-db</a>. You may notice later there are some differences on my exploit script but the concept is still the same with the original author.</p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
