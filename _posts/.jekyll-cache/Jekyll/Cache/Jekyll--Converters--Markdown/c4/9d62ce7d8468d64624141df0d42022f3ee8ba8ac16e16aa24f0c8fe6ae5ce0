I"Â<p>Hello world!</p>

<p>In this post, we will take a look on how to start doing analysis of an .ipa(ios app store package) file and what pointers that you can use to start looking for vulnerability in the application.</p>

<p>Just like an .apk(Android Package) file, .ipa is just a ‚Äúzip‚Äù file that consist with components that bundle together with the application binary so it can be run in the IOS device.</p>

<p>We can take a look on what‚Äôs inside the file by just using the ‚Äúunzip‚Äù utility.</p>

<h2> Setting Up The Environment </h2>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Target: We will use Headbook-app.ipa file from <a href="https://ivrodriguez.com/mobile-ctf/">ipa-file</a></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>OS: I will use mac os</p>
  </li>
</ul>
